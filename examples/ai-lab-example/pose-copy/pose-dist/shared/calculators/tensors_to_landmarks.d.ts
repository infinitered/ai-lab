 * A calculator for converting Tensors from regression models into landmarks.

 * the model.
 * @param landmarkTensor List of Tensors of type float32. Only the first tensor
 * will be used. The size of the values must be (num_dimension x num_landmarks).
 * @param flipHorizontally Optional. Whether to flip landmarks horizontally or
 * not. Overrides corresponding field in config.
 * @param flipVertically Optional. Whether to flip landmarks vertically or not.
 * Overrides corresponding field in config.
 *
 * @param config
